3. Desktop Application
The desktop app is designed for library staff and administrators who manage day-to-day library operations. It focuses on fast, local access to critical functions and may work offline with the ability to sync data when connected.

Key Features:
Book Check-In/Check-Out:

Scan barcodes or manually enter book information to check out books to members or return them to the inventory.
Real-time update of book availability in the database.
Fines and Payments:

Issue fines for overdue books directly in the app and record payment when the fine is paid (in cash or online).
Inventory Management:

Track the total number of books, new arrivals, damaged books, or books that need replacement.
Automate reminders for books that havenâ€™t been returned or are overdue.
Membership Management:

Add new members or update existing member information.
Process membership renewals and issue new membership cards.
Reservation Management:

Track and update reservations, alert members when their reserved books are ready for pick-up.
Reporting:

Generate detailed reports on book loans, member activity, overdue books, and financial records (fines, payments).
Integration with Website:

Synchronize with the online database to ensure that both the desktop app and the website have the same up-to-date information.
Technologies:
Desktop App:
Java (using JavaFX or Swing), or
C#/.NET (using WPF or WinForms), or
Electron.js (JavaScript-based cross-platform desktop apps).
Database Sync:
Use a local SQLite database for offline operations, syncing with the main MySQL/PostgreSQL database when the app is back online.
